time  4X most likely time  pessimistic time 6 Example PERT weighted average   8 workdays  4 X 10 workdays  24 workdays   12  days 6 where optimistic time 8 days most likely time  10 days and pessimistic time  24 days     Therefore youd use 12 days on the network diagram  instead of 10 when using PERT for the above example 56 Copyright 2014 Information Technology Project  Management Seventh Edition Goals are to know the status of the schedule  influence factors that cause schedule changes
